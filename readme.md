# Neo-Express

[![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Neo.Express)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Neo.Express/)
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ngdenterprise/Build/_apis/build/status/neo-project.neo-express?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/ngdenterprise/Build/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=master)

Neo-Express is a Private Net that is optimized for
development scenarios. It is built on the same Neo platform core as
[neo-cli](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/node/cli/setup.html) and
[neo-gui](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/node/gui/install.html) ensuring that
blockchain application code runs the same in production as it does in the
Neo-Express development environment.

Neo-Express provides the following features:

- Blockchain instance management
- Wallet management
- Asset management
- Smart contract management
- Blockchain checkpoint and rollback

Docs are somewhat limited at this point. Please review the
[Command Reference](docs/command-reference.md) to get an understanding of
Neo-Express capabilities.

## A Message from the Engineer

Thanks for checking out Neo-Express! I am eager to hear your opinion of the product.

If you like Neo-Express, please let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devhawk),
[email](mailto:devhawk@outlook.com) or the [Neo Discord server](https://discord.gg/G5WEPwC).

If there are things about Neo-Express you don't like, please file issues in our
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express/issues). You can hit me up on
Twitter, Discord or email as well, but GitHub issues are how we track improvements
we make to Neo-Express. So don't be shy - file an issue if there is anything
you'd like to see changed in the product.

Most software is built by teams of people. However, Neo-Express so far has been
a solo effort. I'm looking forward to having other folks contribute in the future,
but so far it's just been me. That means that Neo-Express has been designed around
my experiences and my perspective. I can't help it, my perspective is the only
one I have! :) So while I find Neo-Express intuitive, I realize that you may not
feel the same. Please let me know if this is the case! I didn't build Neo-Express
for me, I built it for the Neo developer community at large. So if there are
changes we can make to make Neo-Express more accessible, intuitive, easier to
use or just flat-out better - I want to hear about them.

Thanks again for checking out Neo-Express. I look forward to hearing from you.

### Install Preview Releases

Neo-Express has a public [build server](https://dev.azure.com/NGDSeattle/Public/_build?definitionId=24)
and [NuGet feed](https://dev.azure.com/NGDSeattle/Public/_packaging?_a=package&feed=NeoPublicPackages&package=Neo.Express&protocolType=NuGet).
You can install preview builds of Neo-express by specifying the nuget feed source
when running the dotnet tool install or update command.

Note, if the version isn't specified, the most recent release branch build will
be installed. For preview releases, the explicit version must be specified.
For more information, please see the
[dotnet tool install command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-tool-install#options)
